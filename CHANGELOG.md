# Changelog

All notable changes to Stuxedo Status are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Date Versioning](https://datevers.ing) since v26.10.23 (`YY.MM.DD`, the UTC release date, with `-1`, `-2`… for later releases the same day); earlier releases used [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## v26.10.23

### Added

- `tests/version.sh`, which checks that `VERSION.md` is a valid Date Version, a real calendar date not in the future, and the same as the newest entry in this changelog

### Changed

- Switched from Semantic Versioning to [Date Versioning](https://datevers.ing): releases are numbered by their UTC release date as `YY.MM.DD`, with `-1`, `-2`… for later releases the same day. This release follows v1.0.2
- `commit.sh` and `commit.bat` refuse a `VERSION.md` that isn't a valid Date Version or is dated in the future (UTC), and warn when it's dated before today
- `README.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md` describe Date Versioning and the release steps

## [1.0.2] - 2026-10-09

### Changed

- The status page header shows just the Stuxedo icon (`icon-light.png`) instead of the full logo

## [1.0.1] - 2026-10-09

### Changed

- The logos and icons in the Markdown docs (README and the like) follow GitHub's light or dark theme, using each brand's `logo-light`/`logo-dark` and `icon-light`/`icon-dark` files

## [1.0.0] - 2026-10-09

### Added

- Stuxedo Status (`status.stuxedo.net`), built with [GitHup](https://githup.stux.group): checks every 5 minutes (catching up when GitHub runs the schedule late), incident Issues, and the status page deployed to GitHub Pages by `.github/workflows/status.yml`
- The servers (robo1, tiny1, kitt1, mixr1, down1), their daily certificate checks and the Stuxedo site, moved here from Stux.Group Status with their history and slugs, so the Stuxedo and Stux.Cloud region pages keep working; plus the Stuxedo media CDN
- Links to the web hosting status page (stuxedostatus.com) and Stux.Group Status
- Stuxedo branding (`logo-light.png`, `icon-light.png`, neon `#4BF708` accent) and GitHup's Boring Legal Stuff hub and six legal pages for Stuxedo, plus its 404, sitemap page, `sitemap.xml` and `robots.txt`
- `dev-server.sh` / `dev-server.bat` (example data, DEV_MODE on by default, `--no-dev-mode` for production rendering), and `commit.sh` / `commit.bat` for tagged releases
